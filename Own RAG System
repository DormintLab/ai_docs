# RAG System Implementation

## Qdrant for Vector Storage  
Qdrant was chosen as the vector storage engine, particularly for its ability to support time-based information retrieval. It uses HNSW indexing for efficient approximate nearest neighbor searches and supports metadata filtering, which is critical for contextual and temporal queries.

## Document Parsing with Unstructured  
For parsing documents, the `unstructured` library is used to handle multiple formats, including PDFs, DOCX, JSON, and tables. This ensures consistent content extraction while preserving structural integrity, making it suitable for downstream processing.

---

## Semantic and Graph-Based Chunking  
Chunking is achieved through semantic and graph-based approaches:  
- **Semantic Chunking:** Breaks content into meaningful segments at logical points, such as paragraphs or sections.  
- **Graph-Based Chunking:** Adds relational insights, capturing hierarchical structures or references for nuanced segmentation.

---

## Multi-Vector Content Processing  
Each chunk is processed to generate multiple vectors:  
- **Contextual Embeddings:** Created using sentence-transformer models.  
- **Keyword-Based Embeddings:** Extracted with tools like `KeyBERT`.  
- **Structural Embeddings:** Encoded to represent document hierarchy.  

These vectors are stored in Qdrant to support diverse query-matching strategies.

---

## Query Auto-Augmentation  
Queries are enhanced through auto-augmentation:  
- The system enriches the initial input with synonyms, related terms, and contextual refinements.  
- Multi-vector traversal retrieves the most relevant matches.  
- A feedback loop improves augmentation strategies over time.

---

## Multi-Index Search and Reranking  
The system uses multiple indices for efficient and accurate searches:  
- **Semantic, Keyword, and Structural Indices:** Enable hybrid retrieval approaches.  
- **Reranking:** Combines fusion techniques (e.g., score fusion) with cross-encoder models to refine results based on contextual relevance.

---

## Metadata Storage and Propagation  
Metadata, such as title, author, source, and date, is extracted and stored alongside each document.  
- **Propagation:** Metadata is linked to document chunks, allowing for fine-grained filtering.  
- **Custom Fields:** User-defined metadata fields accommodate domain-specific needs.

---

## Metadata-Aware Hybrid Search  
Qdrant's metadata filtering capabilities enable precise queries, such as filtering by document source or recency.  
- **Hybrid Search:** Combines metadata filtering with vector similarity searches for accurate and domain-relevant results.

This RAG system effectively integrates advanced tools and techniques, delivering a scalable and highly accurate pipeline for retrieval-augmented generation.
