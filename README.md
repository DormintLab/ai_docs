# Project Description  

3 principles underlying the Dormint platform for AI agents:
- All business logic of the AI agent should be represented as a Miro-like interface, where nodes correspond to specific services (Telegram, Twitter, message receiving/sending, stock market events, and others), and connections define the flow of data between these services.  
- The connections between the business logic nodes can be described in text, specifying what data is transmitted and how it is processed. Based on this description, the code for implementing the logic can be automatically generated by ChatGPT, simplifying development and minimizing human errors.  
- The configuration of a business logic node (e.g., Telegram, Twitter, message receiving/sending, stock market events, and more) can also be described in plain text, specifying settings, parameters, and behavior. Based on this textual description, ChatGPT can automatically generate the code to implement the configuration, streamlining the setup process and reducing the risk of errors.  

In this regard, the Dormint AI platform allows users to create their own AI agent without any coding knowledge, relying solely on product logic.

# AI Agent launching steps  

### Step 1.
The user finds the necessary nodes in the Dormint AI marketplace and drags them into the Miro-like interface. In each node, the user describes the logic of how the node operates using text description. (For example, which messages to filter for a Telegram bot or how to format an email in Mailtrap, and so on.)

### Step 2.
The user defines the data flow by connecting business logic nodes to each other, AI adapters, and memory nodes (e.g., RAG, standard, etc.). Here, the user describes how data is transformed and moved between business logic nodes. (For example, the ChatGPT response should be placed in the email body, or user messages should be passed to the ChatGPT JSON API to determine specific parameters.)

### Step 3.
The user initiates the "System Compilation" and receives a functioning AI agent.


# Pre-built business logic nodes  

The Dormint platform offers pre-built nodes for creating AI agents focused on sleep and health, including integrations with Google Health and Apple Health.  

These integrations include:  

- Triggers for poor sleep patterns  
- Triggers for increased heart rate    
- Triggers for health deterioration  
and many more, enabling the development of AI agents based on a person's health condition.
