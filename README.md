# Project Description  

3 principles underlying the Dormint platform for AI agents:
- All business logic of the AI agent should be represented as a Miro-like interface, where nodes correspond to specific services (Telegram, Twitter, message receiving/sending, stock market events, and others), and connections define the flow of data between these services.  
- The connections between the business logic nodes can be described in text, specifying what data is transmitted and how it is processed. Based on this description, the code for implementing the logic can be automatically generated by ChatGPT, simplifying development and minimizing human errors.  
- The configuration of a business logic node (e.g., Telegram, Twitter, message receiving/sending, stock market events, and more) can also be described in plain text, specifying settings, parameters, and behavior. Based on this textual description, ChatGPT can automatically generate the code to implement the configuration, streamlining the setup process and reducing the risk of errors.  

In this regard, the Dormint AI platform allows users to create their own AI agent without any coding knowledge, relying solely on product logic.

# AI Agent launching steps  

### Step 1.
The user finds the necessary nodes in the Dormint AI marketplace and drags them into the Miro-like interface. In each node, the user describes the logic of how the node operates using text description. (For example, which messages to filter for a Telegram bot or how to format an email in Mailtrap, and so on.)

### Step 2.
The user defines the data flow by connecting business logic nodes to each other, AI adapters, and memory nodes (e.g., RAG, standard, etc.). Here, the user describes how data is transformed and moved between business logic nodes. (For example, the ChatGPT response should be placed in the email body, or user messages should be passed to the ChatGPT JSON API to determine specific parameters.)

### Step 3.
The user initiates the "System Compilation" and receives a functioning AI agent.


# Pre-built business logic nodes  

The Dormint platform offers pre-built nodes for creating AI agents focused on sleep and health, including integrations with Google Health and Apple Health.  

These integrations include:  

- Triggers for poor sleep patterns  
- Triggers for increased heart rate    
- Triggers for health deterioration  
and many more, enabling the development of AI agents based on a person's health condition.

The platform includes built-in configurations with popular social networks such as X, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and others. It allows users to respond to new posts in these networks, create AI-generated content, and post it directly, enabling users to monetize their activity on these platforms.

The platform also offers numerous integrations with various AI services such as MidJourney, Anthropic, ChatGPT, and others. These integrations enable the creation of high-quality materials using AI and significantly enhance the user experience.

# Creating Custom Integrations

The Dormint platform allows users to build their own integrations with external services, providing flexibility to expand functionality based on unique needs. Key features include:  

1. API Connectivity:
Users can connect to any service that offers an API by defining endpoints, authentication methods, and request parameters directly within the platform.  
   
2. Custom Nodes:
Dormint enables the creation of custom business nodes that encapsulate the logic for interacting with external services. Users can define inputs, outputs, and data transformations tailored to the specific integration.  

3. Scalable Design: 
Once created, custom integrations can be reused across multiple projects or shared within the Dormint marketplace, allowing for collaborative development and scaling of AI agents.  

With these capabilities, Dormint empowers users to enhance their AI agents with virtually unlimited connectivity and tailor-made functionality.


# Node example  

### TelegramBot

Inputs:
- Bot token
- Filter for which user messages to process
- Description of how to generate a response for the user

UI interface:
- Two handles for receiving and sending messages
- UI inputs with bot token and prompts descriptions

Code template which represents docker-based service 
A part of the service code is missing and will be written using ChatGPT based on the input data.


# Revenue streams, how the Economy of an AI Agent Works  

The AI agent ecosystem is made up of several interconnected components, each playing a crucial role in generating value and driving revenue. Here's how it operates:

1. **AI Agent Creators**:  
   These are individuals or organizations that conceptualize, design, and deploy AI agents. They build the logic, functionality, and purpose of each agent, whether it's for content generation, trading, customer service, or other applications.

2. **Teams Providing Business Logic Nodes**:  
   These teams create specialized nodes that define the business logic of AI agents. These nodes represent various functionalities such as social media integrations, financial tools, health-related APIs, or other domain-specific logic. Their role is to make it easier for AI agents to interact with external services and execute specific tasks effectively.

3. **Cloud Providers**:  
   Cloud providers host the infrastructure needed for AI agents to run. These include the servers, storage, and computational resources required for processing large amounts of data. Cloud providers play an essential role in ensuring that AI agents are scalable, reliable, and performant.

4. **Platforms for AI Agent Operation**:  
   These platforms are where the AI agents operate and generate value. Examples include social media platforms (like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube), trading platforms, subscription services, and other ecosystems where the AI agents can perform tasks such as generating content, managing accounts, providing services, or even trading financial assets.

### **Revenue Model Breakdown:**

- **AI Agents** generate revenue in various ways, such as:
   - **Content Creation**: AI agents can generate high-quality content for platforms like YouTube or Instagram, monetize through ads, sponsorships, or product promotions.
   - **Subscription-based Services**: AI agents can offer automated subscription services, such as premium content, automated support, or personalized experiences.
   - **Trading**: AI agents can execute trading strategies on financial markets, making profits from the stock market or cryptocurrency trading.
   - **Other Services**: AI agents can engage in activities such as lead generation, automated consultations, or even affiliate marketing, creating additional income streams.

- **Platform’s Commission**:  
   For hosting and enabling these AI agents, the platform takes a **commission** for each agent created and deployed on their infrastructure. This is how the platform generates its income—by enabling creators to launch their agents and take a share of the profits.

- **Cloud Provider's Fee**:  
   Cloud providers charge AI agent creators based on their usage of computing resources. This could include storage, processing power, and network bandwidth. The pricing model is typically usage-based, where the more resources an AI agent consumes, the higher the cost to the agent creator.

- **Node Creators' Commission**:  
   Teams or developers who provide business logic nodes take a **commission** whenever their nodes are used within an AI agent. This commission is typically a fee based on the amount of usage or the frequency with which their nodes are invoked by AI agents in operation.

### **Economic Flow**:  
The economic flow works as follows:  
1. **AI Agent Creators** develop and deploy their agents.  
2. The platform helps them monetize the agents by hosting and facilitating revenue-generating activities (e.g., content creation, subscription services).  
3. **Cloud Providers** provide the necessary infrastructure for these agents to operate, charging for their services.  
4. **Node Providers** charge a commission based on the usage of their logic by the agents.  
5. **Revenue Generation**: As the AI agents generate revenue, the creators earn money based on the performance and success of the agents, while the platform, cloud provider, and node creators also earn from their respective commissions.

This creates a multi-layered, collaborative economy where various stakeholders contribute to and benefit from the value generated by AI agents.
